# Dependency Comparison Report

## Overview
This report compares the dependencies listed in `Pipfile` and `requirements.txt` to ensure all are accounted for and versions match.

## Methodology
The comparison was performed by manually analyzing both files and checking:
1. If all packages in requirements.txt are in Pipfile
2. If all packages in Pipfile are in requirements.txt
3. If the versions match between both files

## Results

### Packages in Both Files
| Package | requirements.txt | Pipfile | Match |
|---------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| flask | 2.3.3 | 2.3.3 | ✅ |
| python-docx | 0.8.11 | 0.8.11 | ✅ |
| weasyprint | 59.0 | 59.0 | ✅ |
| docx2pdf | 0.1.8 | 0.1.8 | ✅ |
| python-dateutil | 2.8.2 | 2.8.2 | ✅ |
| pytest | 7.4.0 | 7.4.0 | ✅ |
| jinja2/Jinja2 | 3.1.3 | 3.1.3 | ✅ |
| werkzeug/Werkzeug | 2.3.7 | 2.3.7 | ✅ |
| markupsafe/MarkupSafe | 2.1.3 | 2.1.3 | ✅ |
| click | 8.1.7 | 8.1.7 | ✅ |
| itsdangerous | 2.1.2 | 2.1.2 | ✅ |

### Packages Only in requirements.txt
None

### Packages Only in Pipfile
None

### Version Mismatches
None

### Case Sensitivity Notes
Some packages have different case in the two files, but Python package names are case-insensitive:
- `Jinja2` in requirements.txt vs `jinja2` in Pipfile
- `Werkzeug` in requirements.txt vs `werkzeug` in Pipfile
- `MarkupSafe` in requirements.txt vs `markupsafe` in Pipfile

## Summary
- All dependencies are present in both files
- All versions match between the files
- No discrepancies were found
- The only difference is the case of some package names, which is not a functional issue

## Recommendations
1. The dependency management can be safely consolidated to use Pipfile as the single source of truth
2. No changes are needed to ensure all dependencies are accounted for
3. Consider moving `pytest` to the `[dev-packages]` section in Pipfile since it's a testing dependency
