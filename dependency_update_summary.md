# Dependency Update Summary

## Changes Made to Pipfile

1. Moved `pytest` from the `[packages]` section to the `[dev-packages]` section
   - This better reflects its role as a development/testing dependency rather than a production dependency
   - Version constraint `==7.4.0` has been maintained

## Verification

- All dependencies from requirements.txt are still accounted for in Pipfile
- All version constraints from requirements.txt have been maintained
- Production dependencies remain in the [packages] section
- Development dependencies (pytest) are now properly categorized in the [dev-packages] section

## Next Steps

- Generate an updated Pipfile.lock (Task 1.3)
- Continue with the dependency management consolidation plan
