# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This system will provide a web interface for users to input procurement data, which will then be used to automatically generate official government procurement documents in .docx or .pdf format. The system aims to streamline the document creation process, reduce errors, and ensure compliance with government procurement regulations. The system will be stateless, with no database required, as documents will be generated on-demand and provided for immediate download without persistent storage.
