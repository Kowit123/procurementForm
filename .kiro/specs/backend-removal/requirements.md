# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing the Flask backend from the procurement document generator project and converting it to a pure frontend application. The goal is to simplify the project structure while maintaining all existing functionality, particularly the PDF generation capabilities that are currently handled client-side.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove the Flask backend dependencies, so that the project becomes easier to deploy and maintain as a static frontend application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is removed THEN the application SHALL still generate PDF documents using client-side JavaScript
2. WHEN the backend is removed THEN all static assets SHALL be accessible without a Flask server
3. WHEN the backend is removed THEN the project SHALL have no Python dependencies for runtime operation
4. IF the application is opened directly in a browser THEN it SHALL function without requiring a web server

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve all existing frontend functionality, so that users can continue to generate procurement documents without any loss of features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is removed THEN the PDF generation functionality SHALL continue to work identically
2. WHEN the backend is removed THEN all form validation SHALL continue to function
3. WHEN the backend is removed THEN all Thai language utilities SHALL remain accessible
4. WHEN the backend is removed THEN all styling and UI components SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update the project structure, so that it reflects a pure frontend application without backend artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is removed THEN Flask-related files SHALL be removed from the project
2. WHEN the backend is removed THEN Python backend dependencies SHALL be removed from requirements
3. WHEN the backend is removed THEN the main HTML file SHALL be accessible at the project root
4. WHEN the backend is removed THEN all asset paths SHALL be updated to work without Flask routing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the changes don't affect other feature branches, so that parallel development can continue safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend removal changes are made THEN they SHALL only affect the remove_backend branch
2. WHEN the changes are complete THEN other branches SHALL remain unaffected until explicitly merged
3. WHEN conflicts arise during future merges THEN they SHALL be clearly identifiable and resolvable
4. IF the removal process needs to be reverted THEN it SHALL be possible without affecting other branches
